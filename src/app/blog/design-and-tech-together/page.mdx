# How Design and Tech Work Together to Solve Real Problems

Design without engineering is imagination; engineering without design is machinery. The magic happens when the two meet.

## Principles
- Start from outcomes. What business or user result are we targeting?
- Constrain with systems. Budgets, timelines, security, and scalability create clarity.
- Iterate with prototypes. Low‑fidelity first, then refine.

## A Simple Framework
1. Discover: Interview users, map constraints, define success.
2. Design: Wireframe, test, validate.
3. Develop: Build the thinnest slice that proves value.
4. Deploy: Measure, learn, repeat.

> Great products make the complex feel simple. That’s the craft.
